   1)   What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
   
        I was famliar with the Javascript and AJAX, so it was easy for me.
        
   2)   What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
   
        Hard part was to deploy on heroku as there were compatibility problems with the application that i have created. That is                 the only part i have found difficult.
        
   3)   If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?
   
        I think i would prefer to use Jquery as it is more reliable and popular as well as easy to implement. My only concern was      compatibility on different platform.
